// Migrate executes all migrations UP that did not run yet.
//
// 1. Migrations must be backward compatible and only extend the schema.
// 2. Migration ID must be a unix epoch time in seconds (use 'date +%s').
// 3. Although in the current shape schema downgrades are not supported,
//    Rollback function must be also provided, and migrations must not import
//    any models in order to avoid side effects: instead, the type should be
//    explicitly defined within the migration body.
//
// A note on schema downgrades (not supported yet):
//
// As long as migrations are backward compatible, support for schema downgrade
// is not required. Once we introduce a breaking change (e.g, change column
// name or modify the data in any way), downgrades must be supported.
//
// The problem is that this requires migrator to know the future schema:
// v0.4.4 can't know which actions should be taken to revert the database from
// v0.4.5, but not vice-versa (unless they use the same source of migration
// scripts). There are some options:
//  - Changes can be reverted with the later version (that is installed before
//    the application downgrade) or with an independent tool â€“ in containerized
//    deployments this can cause significant difficulties.
//  - Store migrations (as raw SQL scripts) in the database itself or elsewhere
//    locally/remotely.
//
// Before we have a very strong reason to perform a schema downgrade or violate
// the schema backward compatibility guaranties, we should follow the basic
// principle: "... to maintain backwards compatibility between the DB and all
// versions of the code currently deployed in production."
// (https://flywaydb.org/documentation/concepts/migrations#important-notes).
// On the other hand, "the lack of an effective rollback script can be a gating
// factor in the integration and deployment process" (Database Reliability
// Engineering by Laine Campbell & Charity Majors).
